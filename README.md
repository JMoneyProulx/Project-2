# Template for the Basic Data Analysis & Visualization Project

This project to me was fun, but a little complicated. I found it hard to communicate with github again. Overall, I believe the dataset was well organized and cleaned up giving it a simple yet understandable look. Throughout the assignment I had troubles but when I figured it out it was the best feeling.
